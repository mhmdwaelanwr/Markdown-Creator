# Contributing to Advanced Readme Creator

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
2.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code Style

*   Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
*   Use `flutter analyze` to check for linting errors.
*   Use `dart format .` to format your code.
